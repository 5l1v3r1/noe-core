# Contributing to Noe Core

Thank you for considering contribution to Noe Core. As a potential contributor, your changes and ideas are always welcome. Please do not ever hesitate to ask a question or send a Pull Request.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs
If you come across what seems to be a bug, please use the Github [issue tracker](https://github.com/web-servers/noe-core/issues) and file an issue. An issue can also be used for discussions. 

### Contributing Documentation
Documentation is crucial for success of any project. If you feel like there is lack of documentation in some area, feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/web-servers/noe-core/issues). If you want to contribute documentation, feel free to open a PR with your changes. Your contribution may or may not be changed with stylistic and grammatical corrections; do not expect to see your changes ad verbum in the code.

### Contributing Code
